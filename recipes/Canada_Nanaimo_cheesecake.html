    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The taste of a Nanaimo bar in a cheesecake! Can't get any better than
      this. Make in the jelly roll pan for serving a larger crowd. Result is
      thinner but still as tasty. (You will need to adjust baking time if you
      use the bigger pan.)

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2 ½ cups crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREO®
      Cookies)
    </li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped pecans</li>
    <li>½ cup flaked coconut</li>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup custard powder (such as Bird's® Custard Powder)</li>
    <li>¼ cup custard powder (such as Bird's® Custard Powder)</li>
    <li>6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>
      Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a
      bowl until the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a
      9x13-inch baking dish, and refrigerate while making filling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an
      electric mixer until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time,
      beating each until fully incorporated before adding the next. Layer the
      filling over the crust.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40
      minutes. Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the
      cream, and stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the
      chocolate mixture over the cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the
      middle layer, and refrigerate until the topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes.
      Serve cold. Store leftovers in refrigerator.
